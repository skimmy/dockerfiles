# Collection of dockerfile

Contains useful dockerfiles, used in various projects. Files are divided by language and/or environment, the repository is sill a work-in-progress.

See by [Docker Hub Page][1]

**Notice** in some cases, there will also be [Singularity][2] definition file.

## Directories

The following directories are present and contain various sub-directory for several projects.

* ``dev``: containers used for general development, *i.e.*, not specific for research projects or teaching material
* ``research``: containers used for research purposes, unless private, these project will have their own accessible repositories
* ``teaching``: containers used for teaching purposes

**Notice** there could many cases where the files could be duplicated (*e.g.*, one in ``dev`` and another in ``research``) this is
to be expected since some projects may be finished, yet the code could still be compiled and/or run using the provided container.
